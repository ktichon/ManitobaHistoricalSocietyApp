    <string name="about_text">Welcome to my app! History has always been a passion of mine, and I quite excited to combine it with my love of coding.
        \n\nI started working on this app in October 2022, displaying all Historical Sites according to the <a href="https://data.winnipeg.ca/City-Planning/Historical-Resources/ptpx-kgiu">City of Winnipeg Open Data</a>. With the data from the City of Winnipeg, I was able to display around 720 sites. While I was excited by what I was able to accomplish, the Winnipeg data was limited in what it could display. I knew that I could do more.
        \n\nAlmost a year after starting this project, I was successful in collecting 99% of the data from the <a href="https://www.mhs.mb.ca">Manitoba Historical Society</a>, and now this app displays over 9360 historical all across Manitoba!
        \n\nThank you Manitoba Historical Society for providing all the information about this history of this province.
        \n\nCreated by me, Kyle Tichon.
